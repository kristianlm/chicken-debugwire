* AVR debugWIRE library

This is a [[https://call-cc.org][Chicken Scheme 5]] library which lets you operate a AVR
microcontroller using its on-board [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DebugWIRE][debugWIRE]] facility. It implements
parts of the proprietary serial protocol, and exposes an API that
allows you to:

- Read and write device registers and SRAM
- Read and write device flash memory
- Start and stop device CPU

It's based off of the wonderful work of [[http://www.ruemohr.org/docs/debugwire.html][RikusW]], [[https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug][David C W Brown]] and
[[https://github.com/dwtk/dwtk][Rafael G. Martins]]. The typical use of debugWIRE is indirectly through
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger][gdb]], where the aforementioned projects shine. This library, however,
takes a slightly different approach and tries to give you a Scheme
REPL experience when working with these microcontrollers.

The project stage is experimental, at best! And only the ATtiny85
microcontroller is currently supported. If you actually just want to
start with debugWIRE, I'd strongly recommend the projects above.

** Getting started

You'll need to enable debugWIRE on your target device. This means
programming the ~DWEN~ bit, which you'll probably have to do with the
usual ICSP setup and then something like:

#+begin_src bash
> avrdude -p attiny85 -U hfuse:w:0x9F:m
#+end_src

Once the target is debugWIRE-enabled, the RESET pin becomes available
for debugWIRE commands. Pulling this line low for a few microseconds
should give you the famous ~0x55~ greeting:

[[./images/debugwire-55-greeting.png]]

On can pull the line low manually, and then check for a 55 response on
a scope before fighting UART drivers and baud rates. A prolonged low
signal like this is invalid serial communication, and is called a
~break~, hence the red ~?~ after 00. It's used to, unsurprisingly,
break the target device's CPU. From there on, you can issue various
commands and is where this library may prove useful.

Please follow the hardware setup guide at [[https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug/#ft232rch340-usb-uart-hardware][dwire-debug]] for the UART
setup. You'll only need a good USB-UART adapter and a diode (plus
something to enable debugWIRE).

Not yet documented, sorry. Please read [[debugwire.scm]].

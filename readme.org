* AVR debugWIRE library

This is a [[https://call-cc.org][Chicken Scheme 5]] library which lets you operate a AVR
microcontroller using its on-board [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DebugWIRE][debugWIRE]] facility. It implements
parts of the proprietary serial protocol, and exposes an API that
allows you to:

- Start and stop device CPU
- Read and write device registers and SRAM
- Read and write device flash memory
- Execute arbitrary assembly instructions (16-bit opcodes only)

It's based off of the wonderful work of [[http://www.ruemohr.org/docs/debugwire.html][RikusW]], [[https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug][David C W Brown]] and
[[https://github.com/dwtk/dwtk][Rafael G. Martins]]. The typical use of debugWIRE is indirectly through
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Debugger][gdb]], where the aforementioned projects shine. This library, however,
takes a slightly different approach and tries to give you a Scheme
REPL experience when working with these microcontrollers.

âš  The project stage is experimental, at best! And only the ATtiny85
microcontroller is currently supported. If you actually just want to
start with debugWIRE, I'd strongly recommend the projects above.

** Getting started

You'll need to enable debugWIRE on your target device. This means
programming the ~DWEN~ bit, which you'll probably have to do with the
usual ICSP setup and then something like:

#+begin_src bash
  > avrdude -p attiny85 -U hfuse:w:0x9F:m
#+end_src

Once the target is debugWIRE-enabled, the RESET pin becomes available
for debugWIRE commands. Pulling this line low for a few microseconds
should give you the famous ~0x55~ greeting:

[[./images/debugwire-55-greeting.png]]

On can pull the line low manually, and then check for a 55 response on
a scope before fighting UART drivers and baud rates. This fixed
response can be used to detect the target baud rate (usually F_CPU /
64).

A prolonged low signal like this is an invalid serial frame. It's
called a ~break~, hence the red ~?~ on my scope. It's used to,
unsurprisingly, break the running target CPU. Once stopped, you can
issue various commands like reading registers and executing ad-hoc
instructions. This is where this library comes into play.

Please follow the hardware setup guide at [[https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug/#ft232rch340-usb-uart-hardware][dwire-debug]] for the UART
setup. You'll only need a good USB-UART adapter and a diode (plus
something to enable debugWIRE). Your adapter needs to be able to
generate a proper break signal and baudrates that match the target.

*** Example REPL session

#+begin_src scheme
  > git clone chicken-debugwire && cd chicken-debugwire
  > chicken-install .
  > rlwrap csi

  ;; let's get ready
  #;> (import avr.debugwire avr.asm chicken.blob)
  #;> (dw-open! "/dev/ttyUSB1" (/ 4000000 64))
  #;> (dw-break!)
  dw-break-expect: serial read 85

  ;; CPU is now halted. let's have a look at register 24:
  #;> (r 24)
  0
  #;> (set! (r 24) 100)
  #;> (r 24)
  100
  #;> inc
  #<procedure (inc d)>
  #;> (inc 24)
  #${8395}                  ;; <-- machine code / opcode for inc 24
  #;> (dw-exec (inc 24))    ;; let's increment r24!
  #;> (r 24)
  101
  #;> (dw-exec (inc 24))    ;; let's repeat this for sheer joy
  #;> (r 24)
  102
#+end_src

** API

Not yet documented, sorry. Please read [[debugwire.scm]]. However,
below are some of the ~getter-with-setter~ procedures. They expose
various named variables of different sizes for convenience. They're
typically used like this: ~(r 0)~ or ~(set! (r 0) 255)~ to access
~r0~.

| name    | size | where    | description                                                                                                        |
|---------+------+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (PC)    |    8 | dw       | aka Program Counter. Used/overwritten in various occations. Read immediately after dw-break! to get the "real" PC. |
| (BP)    |    8 | dw       | aka Break-point. Used/overwritten in various places. Set to flash address before dw-continue* for "run to cursor". |
| (IR)    |    8 | dw       | aka Instruction register. Holds an arbitrary 16-bit opcode for immediate execution                                 |
| (r /x/) |    8 | register | raw register access, where /x/ is 0 - 31.                                                                          |
| (X)     |   16 | register | ~(r 26)~ and ~(r 27)~                                                                                              |
| (Y)     |   16 | register | ~(r 28)~ and ~(r 29)~                                                                                              |
| (Z)     |   16 | register | ~(r 30)~ and ~(r 31)~                                                                                              |
| (SP)    |   16 | sram     | aka Stack Pointer.                                                                                                 |
| (PINB)  |    8 | sram     | Port B Input Pins Address (~#x16~)                                                                                 |
| (DDRB)  |    8 | sram     | Port B Data Direction Register (~#x17~)                                                                            |

** TODOs

This list would be seriously long for this library to turn into
something of real-world value. So here are just a few major points:

*** Restoring target to working order before ~dw-continue~

Since we not only mutate the debugWIRE registers like PC and BP, but
we also mutate the on-target Z register when issuing sram-read etc. We
should keep track of the original values and [[https://github.com/dcwbrown/dwire-debug/blob/a2830d578cce5d11c77cf0c7a3c8cbb6dbb1864a/src/dwire/DwPort.c#L202-L203][
restore them on dw-continue]].

*** Address and register consistency

All assembly instructions just take in integers. We should probably
introduce types here. It's useful to know that an address is of type
flash, we wouldn't have to manually by two when working with ~rjmp~
etc.

*** Integration with avr-gcc and ELF debugging symbols

It's be cool to be able to write C code the usual way, and have access
to it's symbol table from the REPL. This is in danger of
reimplementing a little too much of ~gdb~, though.
